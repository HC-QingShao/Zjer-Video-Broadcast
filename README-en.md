##  👏 Welcome!

This program mainly implements the Zjer video broadcasting function, and more functions will be developed in the future as the version progresses.

##  👀 Website Highlights

There is a complete front-end interface that obtains data through interaction with users.

##  ❗ ️ Precautions

This program only provides continuous broadcasting, and the double speed function will be determined based on subsequent user feedback to determine whether to create this function.

##  🙏 Disclaimers

The program only provides automatic broadcasting services. If it is used for illegal purposes, the consequences are not my responsibility. Do not resell this software!

##  🙋‍♂️ Bug feedback

I will occasionally test the program for bugs to ensure that each version is complete. If you discover a bug, please contact us promptly qingshao1145@gmail.com Contact me, I will handle the bug as soon as possible in the next version.
